            <article>
                <h3>Brand History</h3>
                <p>Ford Motor Company was established in 1903 by Henry Ford and a group of investors in Detroit,
                    Michigan. From its early days, the company aimed to make automobiles accessible to the general
                    public, not just the wealthy. Henry Ford's vision and engineering ingenuity led to one of the most
                    significant industrial breakthroughs of the 20th century — the introduction of the moving assembly
                    line in 1913. This innovation drastically reduced production time and costs, allowing Ford to
                    produce reliable cars at affordable prices.

                    In 1908, Ford introduced the iconic Model T, which became a symbol of innovation and mass mobility.
                    By 1927, over 15 million Model Ts had been sold, and the car transformed personal transportation
                    across the United States and beyond. Ford also pioneered the concept of fair wages, famously
                    offering workers $5 a day — double the average rate — which helped build a strong and loyal
                    workforce.

                    As the decades passed, Ford expanded its lineup with popular models like the Mustang, F-Series
                    trucks, and Explorer, becoming one of the most recognized and trusted automotive brands worldwide.
                    The company played an important role during World War II by producing military vehicles, aircraft
                    engines, and equipment.

                    Today, Ford is focused on the future of mobility. The company is investing heavily in electric
                    vehicles, autonomous technology, and sustainable manufacturing. With new models like the Mustang
                    Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, Ford continues to blend its strong legacy with modern innovation,
                    leading the industry into a new era.</p>

                <p>Toyota was founded in 1937 by Kiichiro Toyoda in Japan. Originally a textile machinery company, it
                    shifted its focus to automobiles and quickly became a pioneer in automotive manufacturing. Toyota is

                    Production System, which revolutionized global manufacturing standards.

                    In 1997, Toyota introduced the Prius, the world's first mass-produced hybrid car, cementing its
                    position as a leader in eco-friendly mobility. Today, Toyota is one of the largest and most
                    respected car manufacturers worldwide, known for reliability, fuel efficiency, and a growing lineup
